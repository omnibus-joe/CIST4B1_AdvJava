# Week 1 Reflection
So far this week was mostly just review of what I already knew. We reviewed the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and went into the basic principals of data structures.
One thing I didn't know was the concept abstract class. It's essentially a template for a class. It can be defined, but not instanciated. This is is similar to interfaces in TypeScript.
For data structures, we talked about why data structures are important to utilize properly. Data structures are how we store and organize data in our programs.
Certain data structures are more optimal for certain scenarios, especially when considering peformance and storage. It is our job as programmers to determine what data structures to use for specfic situations.
The first week was pretty easy, not much new information to cover.
